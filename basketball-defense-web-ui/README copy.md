# Inspiration
There's so many reccomendations on projects that should be worked on to build your portfolio early on. In an attempt to deviate from the "norms" I thought to create a simple web application that shows different defensive formations for 5-man basketball. Since I am a fan of the sport it's easy to maintain interest throughout the development process. This also comes at a time where I am coaching my son in basketball so it's just a way to combine the two things I spend most of my free time doing. (studying programming and coaching my son).

# Dimensions

this page: https://www.recunlimited.com/blog/diagrams-basketball-courts/ was used to create the basketball court layout.
Everything is scaled 7x.
EXAMPLE:

16 ft is equal to (16 * 7)112 in the program.
